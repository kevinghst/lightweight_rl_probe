# Possible sampling schemes:
# 1.  Contrastive: sometimes sample future states in other trajectories
#  Advantage: goal is guaranteed to be a "legal" latent
#             Can just implement as taking other goals in batch.
#  Disadvantage: Might avoid some beneficial exploration in latent space.
# 2.  Purely HER:
#   Downside: likely not to be diverse enough
# 3. HER+noise:  Sample as HER but add noise.
#   Adds diversity, maybe not enough.
# 4.  At random: sample random normalized vectors.
#   Problem: Mostly unreachable, maybe not valid latents.
# Preferred solution: mixture of all methods.
